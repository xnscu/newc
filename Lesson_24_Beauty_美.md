## Lesson 24 Beauty 美

## First listen and then answer the following question.

听录音,然后回答以下问题。

What do glimpses of beauty, either in nature or art, often suggest to the human mind?

A young man sees a sunset and, unable to understand or to express the emotion that it rouses in him, concludes that it must be the gateway to a world that lies beyond. It is difficult for any of us in moments of intense aesthetic experience to resist the suggestion that we are catching a glimpse of a light that shines down to us from a different realm of existence, different and, because the experience is intensely moving, in

5 some way higher. And, though the gleams blind and dazzle, yet do they convey a hint of beauty and serenity greater than we have known or imagined. Greater too than we can describe; for language, which was invented to convey the meanings of this world, cannot readily be fitted to the uses of another.

That all great art has this power of suggesting a world beyond is undeniable. In some moods, Nature shares it. There is no sky in June so blue that it does not point forward to a bluer, no sunset so beautiful that 10 it does not waken the vision of a greater beauty, a vision which passes before it is fully glimpsed, and in passing leaves an indefinable longing and regret. But, if this world is not merely a bad joke, life a vulgar flare amid the cool radiance of the stars, and existence an empty laugh braying across the mysteries; if these intimations of a something behind and beyond are not evil humour born of indigestion, or whimsies sent by the devil to mock and madden us, if, in a word, beauty means something, yet we must not seek to interpret 15 the meaning. If we glimpse the unutterable, it is unwise to try to utter it, nor should we seek to invest with significance that which we cannot grasp. Beauty in terms of our human meanings is meaningless.

2 in some way higher, in some way 是 "在某种程度上" 的意思, higher 与前面的 different and 是并列的, 作 realm of existence 的定语。

3 yet do they convey a hint of beauty, 其中的 do 起强调作用, 放在主语之前更具有强调的意义。

4 In some moods Nature shares it. 在某种状态下, 大自然也具有这种力量。it 是指前面一句中 this power of suggesting a world beyond。

Detail of Madonna and Child-Filippo Lippi (C. 1406-1469)

## 参考译文

一个年轻人看到日落, 由于无法理解和表达日落在他心中唤起的激情, 便得出结论: 日落处想必是通往遥远世界的大门。无论是谁, 在强烈感受到美的时刻, 心中都不禁油然而生一种遐想: 我们似乎瞥见从另一个世界射向我们的一线光芒, 那个世界不仅不同于我们这个世界, 而且由于美感的强烈感染, 在某些方面比我们这个世界更美好。虽然这光芒令人眼花缭乱,但它确实给予我们一种不曾经历和无法想像的美感和静谧的启示。这种美感和静谧是我们无法描述的, 因为我们发明的语言是用来描述我们这个世界的含义, 不能随便拿来去描述另一个世界。

不可否认, 一切伟大的艺术都具有使人遐想到进入天外世界的魅力。在某种状态下, 大自然也有这种魅力。 六月蔚蓝的天空总使人遥想一个更加蔚蓝的苍穹；美丽的落日总会引起一个更加绚丽的景象,这景象未及饱览便一闪即逝,并在消逝中给人留下了不可名状的渴望和惆怅。如果这个世界不只是一个拙劣的恶作剧,如果人生不只是群星寒光中平凡的一闪,如果存在不只是对神秘事物的一阵空虚的笑声,如果某种玄妙事物的暗示不是消化不良引起的邪恶情绪,也不是魔鬼为了捉弄我们,使我们发狂而送给我们的邪念,一句话,如果美有某种意义的话, 我们千万不要去阐明它的意义。如果我瞥见了只可意会不可言传的事物, 企图把它说出来, 那是不明智的; 对于我们不理解的事物, 我们也不应该去赋予它某种意义。用对我们人类有意义的词句来解释美是没有意义的。

## IF YOU CAN DO THIS TEST GO ON TO PART 2

Read the following passage carefully, then do the exercises below:

Television is a method of communication. It is about as revolutionary as the invention of printing. Neither printing nor television is in itself an idea, or power, or good or bad. They are simply methods by which ideas and experiences can be communicated faster to more people. It is perhaps because the characteristics of television, which determine what it can best communicate, are so different from those of printing, that 5 professional educationists were reluctant for so long to interest themselves in the newer method.

Printing and television are certainly alike in that both are costly to the producers of the communication and relatively cheap to the receiver. They are both, therefore, mass media which depend upon reaching great numbers. But whereas the printed word, being relatively permanent, can communicate to numbers of like minds over centuries, television is relatively ephemeral and communicates, using both pictures and words, 10 to millions of unlike minds at the same moment in time. Moreover television appeals not only to those who can read but to those who can't.

Professional educationists, accustomed to communication through words, and highly valuing reading and the quality of the like minds reachable through books, saw television, in its early years, not only as a rival for attention but as an enemy of the good. Some ten years ago a friend said to me: 'We in Oxford may

15 be old fashioned and fuddy-duddy,* but most of us think that television is actively detrimental.' Even that great pioneer of teaching by radio, the late Mary Somerville, had no faith in television. 'It won't last,' she said to me. 'It's a flash in the pan.' And many in the world of education no doubt hoped that this was true.

The situation has now altered. It is clear that television is no flash in the pan. So educationists all over the world are trying to get access to its 'power', often by attempting to use traditional methods of academic 20 teaching to inculcate, through television, the ideas and attitudes in which they devotedly believe. But one of the characteristics of television is that it has no power other than that created by the wish of people to watch it. If nobody watches it, then television has no power.

* old-fashioned.

## Unit 4

## INSTRUCTIONS TO THE STUDENT

## Content

This unit consists of eight passages followed by exercises on Comprehension, Vocabulary, Summary, Composition, Key structures, Special difficulties and Multiple choice questions.

## Aim

To employ the skills you have required in constructing sentences and paragraphs in order to write Summary and Composition.

## How to work

1 Read each passage carefully two or three times.

2 Answer the questions in the order in which they are given.

## Summary

In Part 1 you learnt how to write points in note form to answer a specific question on a passage. When writing Summary, you will be required to do precisely the same thing. This time, however, you will join your points to reconstruct the main ideas of each passages in a limited number of words. Follow the instructions very carefully.

## Composition

In Part 1 you learnt how to write a paragraph from notes which were provided. When writing a composition, you will be required to do precisely the same thing. This time, however, the notes given have not been derived from the passage. They are of a general nature and meant to be suggestions only. You may ignore them altogether if you wish. Follow the instructions very carefully.
